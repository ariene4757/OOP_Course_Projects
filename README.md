# OOP Course Projects - Dr. Mostafa Saad

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the projects required in **Dr. Mostafa Saad's Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course**.

## 🚀 About the Projects
These projects follow the requirements and specifications provided in the course to simulate real-world problem-solving using OOP principles.

## ⚠️ Important Note
While the requirements are from the course, **the code implementation is 100% my own work.** I wrote every line of code from scratch to ensure a deep understanding of concepts like:
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- SOLID Principles
